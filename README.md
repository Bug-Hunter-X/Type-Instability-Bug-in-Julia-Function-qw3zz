This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Julia: type instability.  The `myfunction` in `bug.jl` exhibits this issue. The solution in `bugSolution.jl` illustrates how to avoid this by ensuring type stability. Type instability can lead to performance degradation in Julia, especially with larger datasets, due to increased allocations and compilation time. This example showcases the issue clearly and provides a clear path towards a more efficient solution.
